Assignment: Programming Assignment 1
Author: Jessica May


How to run:

This program can be ran by opening Terminal (or Putty) and entering the folder "jmay_pa1". You can then type "make" to compile the code and then to run, use "./osh -t < " and after the arrow you can enter the files you would like to run.

Disclaimer: I used the TA Yutaka's code for the parser instead of the one provided on canvas.

Difficulities I had:

The majority of my problems came during Phase 4: Pipes for this assingment. I had to work on pipes for about a week, and usually every day, I would make progress and then my code would break. If I would make progress without the rest of the problem breaking, the output wouldn't match the correct output. However, going in to the TA's office hours and asking questions to gain understanding helped me to better understand the pseudocode inside the handout and be able to implement piping correctly. Many of the times, it was small errors I had, like checking the output mode instead of the input mode. 


What I learned:

During this assignment, I learned C++ greatly. I had no prior experience with this language and so to prepare, I did some practice problems on Hackerrank, however those did not prepare me enough for this assignment. I relied heavily on the Internet to know how to translate how I knew how to do things in one language, into C++. I also gained a greated appreciation and understand of how a shell works .
